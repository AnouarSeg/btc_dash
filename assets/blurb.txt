introducing bitcoin dash.  this webapp predicts the closing price of bitcoin one period forward and plot it out on a 50 days rolling chart.  on the left here we have the ohlc candlestick chart of bitcoin in bars and the predicted price in yellow. it automatically refreshes itself every 13 seconds. on the top right, the app displays a momentum indicator using relative strength, ranging from 0 to 100 with 0 being HODL and 100 being FOMO. at the bottom right, the app displays the directional prediction confusion matrix. why? because getting the direction right is a lot more important than getting the magnitude right for financial assets.

how did we do this? artificial intelligence and methods inspired by quantum mechanics. or in more technical terms. ordinary least squares. unfortunately regression does not work for time dependent data and we found bitcoin prices time dependent using augmented dicky fuller tests. so we make it stationary taking first order difference after log transform. in other words, we used log returns and ARIMA. our basline was 0.056 RMSE and directional accuracy of 0.48. our final 60 days rolling ARIMA model is 0.051 RMSE and directional accuracy of 0.51. So we beat our baseline. next step, bigger models.
